### Game brief
This game is inspired by the Alien invason from the book Python Crash Course.

To run:
- python3 shooter_game.py

random notes
----
- pygame treats everything like rects(rectangles) as this is simle geometry
- When youâ€™re working with a rect object, you can use the x- and y-coordinates of the top, bottom, left, and right edges of the rectangle, as well as the center, to place the object
- the main code is in shooter_game.py file, where a while loop in the run_game function calls other functions.
- the check events functions are used to detect relevant events
- the update screen function redraws the screen on each pass
